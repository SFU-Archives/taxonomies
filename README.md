# Taxonomies
SFU Archives maintains a number of taxonomies that provide sets of controlled terms for use in various contexts, e.g. archival description and internal administration. This sites provides the taxonomies currently in use. The taxonomies themselves are maintained in the department's Archives Information System (AIS) database; what is presented here are pdfs output from that system.

## Archival description index terms
SFU-specific terms for indexing archival materials. This is not intended as a generic thesaurus. Rather it is meant to support the location of materials specific to SFU, the Archives' holdings, and the types of inquiries we frequently receive. The taxonomy is used in the AIS to index fonds, accessions, research inquiries, and research products.

## Archives' functions
Terms for describing the functions of the Archives department. Used in the AIS to structure staff workplans and to index policy-related documents.

## Carrier and content types
Terms for describing the physical supports or carriers of archival records; and for describing the contents held on them. The Archives uses these taxonomies for item-level characterization in its AIS database. They generate drop-down value lists in the Object table, used to register non-textual physical media and storage devices.
