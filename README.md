# Taxonomies
SFU Archives maintains a number of taxonomies that provide sets of controlled terms for use in various contexts, e.g. archival description and internal administration. The taxonomies themselves are maintained in the department's Archives Information System (AIS) database and output as markdown files for the Wiki section of this site.
